Numerical simulations of mixing manure slurry which exhibits non-Newtonian pseudo-plastic fluid behavior were performed for six designs: (i) one helical ribbon impeller; (ii) one anchor impeller; (iii) one curtain-type impeller; (iv) three counterflow (CF-2) impellers; (v) two modified high solidity (MHS 3/39°) impellers; and (vi) two pitched blade turbine impellers. The CFD model was validated against measurements for mixing a Herschel-Bulkley fluid by ribbon and anchor impellers. Based on mixing time with respect to mixing energy level, three impeller types (ribbon, CF-2, and MHS 3/39°) stand out when agitating highly viscous fluids, of these mixing with two MHS 3/39° impellers requires the lowest power input to homogenize the manure slurry. A comparison of digestion material demonstrates that the mixing energy varies with manure type and total solids concentration to obtain a given mixing time. Moreover, an in-depth discussion about the CFD strategy, the influences of flow regime and impeller type on mixing characteristics, and the intrinsic relation between mixing and flow field is included. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The flow patterns and mixing process in the cavity were measured by using particle image velocimetry (PIV) and planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) experiments respectively. The refractive indices of the two miscible liquids involved were carefully matched to allow for unhindered optical access. The mixing process was predicted by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) including models for species transport. The simulated flow and mixing results are in good agreement with the experimental data. The effects of density difference and viscosity of the two miscible fluids on the mixing process were evaluated. Minor variations in the densities of the fluids have significant influence on the mixing process in terms of the coefficient of variation as a function of time. The dimensionless group ArRe (Archimedes number over Reynolds number) is proposed to characterize the mixing process in the cavity.},

abstract = {Molasses is a first-generation bioethanol feedstock that is a byproduct of sugar production. Molasses is a viscous fluid; consequently, when it serves as a substrate, it needs to be dissolved in water to obtain the appropriate conditions for the yeast. Therefore, the mixing process of molasses and water is an essential factor that significantly affects the efficiency of the fermentation process. This work aims to study the molasses–water mixing behavior in a cylindrical cone-shaped stirred-tank system reviewed by the effect of the molasses–water rheological characteristics. The molasses–water mixing behavior was investigated through a simple visualization method by using a camera and a 650 nm red laser as an observation plane of molasses–water interface height changes. Based on the results of the rheological characterization, it is known that molasses are a non-Newtonian fluid that exhibits shear thinning behavior. A rheological model molasses–water mixture has been developed. The behavior of molasses–water mixture comprises three zone mechanisms. The Eulerian multiphase model is the closest to the experimental results, and the combination of the Eulerian multiphase model and Large Eddy Simulation can be applied to predict the mixing behavior in an industrial scale stirred-tank.},

abstract = {This paper presents an Eulerian multiphase flow model that characterizes gas mixing in anaerobic digesters. In the model development, liquid manure is assumed to be water or a non-Newtonian fluid that is dependent on total solids (TS) concentration. To establish the appropriate models for different TS levels, twelve turbulence models are evaluated by comparing the frictional pressure drops of gas and non-Newtonian fluid two-phase flow in a horizontal pipe obtained from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with those from a correlation analysis. The commercial CFD software, Fluent12.0, is employed to simulate the multiphase flow in the digesters. The simulation results in a small-sized digester are validated against the experimental data from literature. Comparison of two gas mixing designs in a medium-sized digester demonstrates that mixing intensity is insensitive to the TS in confined gas mixing, whereas there are significant decreases with increases of TS in unconfined gas mixing. Moreover, comparison of three mixing methods indicates that gas mixing is more efficient than mixing by pumped circulation while it is less efficient than mechanical mixing.},

abstract = {Mixing patterns inside a simulated flat bottom digester were imaged using the non-invasive techniques of computer automated radioactive particle tracking (CARPT) and computed tomography (CT). Mixing/agitation was provided using gas (air) recirculation at three different flow rates (Qg) of 28.32, 56.64 and 84.96l/h, corresponding to superficial gas velocities of 0.025, 0.05 and 0.075cm/s, respectively. Better mixing was observed in the upper zone near the top of the draft tube. However, at the bottom of the digester there was a total stagnancy at all the three gas flow rates. The maximum value of the time-averaged axial velocity inside the draft tube, at a gas flow rate of 84.96l/h, was observed as 34.4cm/s. The turbulent kinetic energy was observed to be maximum (724dyn/cm2) inside the draft tube, and decreases radially toward the wall of the digester. The present study showed that the CARPT and CT techniques could be successfully used to identify the flow pattern in the digester and to calculate velocity and turbulence parameters quantitatively. On the other hand, the increase in gas circulation rate from 28.32 to 84.96l/h did not significantly reduce the dead zones inside the flat bottom digester. To achieve the desired mixing and reactor performance, the operating conditions and reactor configuration need to be optimized.},

abstract = {This study aimed to characterise the gas-liquid flow and mixing behaviour in a gas-mixed anaerobic digester by improving phase interaction modelling using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). A 2D axisymmetric model validated with experimental data was set up using an Eulerian-Eulerian method. Uncertainty factors, including bubble size, phase interaction forces and liquid rheology were found to significantly influence the flow field. A more reliable and complete validation was obtained by critical comparison and assessment of the referred experimental data, compared to the models reported in other studies. Additionally, justifiable corrections and predictions in detail were obtained. Mixing was evaluated by trajectory tracking of a large number of particles based on an Euler-Lagrange method. The mixing performance approximated to a laminar-flow reactor (LFR) that distinctly deviated from expected continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) design, indicating limited enhancement from the applied gas-sparging strategy in the studied digester. The study shows the importance of a proper phase-interaction description for a reliable hydrodynamic characterisation and mixing evaluation in gas-mixed digesters. Validations, bend to experimental data without a critical assessment, may lead to an inaccurate model for further scaled-up applications.},

In this study, mixing of two stratified liquids in an unbaffled tank with an angle-mounted impeller was investigated using both experiments and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The results revealed that the mixing time under the stratified conditions could be over an order of magnitude longer than that predicted by a commonly used blend time correlation. Further analysis showed that the observed long mixing time occurred when the buoyancy force due to density difference between the liquids was dominant over the impeller stir and was correlated with high Richardson number. The study also looked into the impact of factors such as liquid height and impeller size, and a new correlation was proposed based on the experimental data.},

Power number and flow number of the propeller in water mixing were validated against lab specifications and experimental data from a field test. The rotational direction and placement of the propeller were examined to identify the primary pumping mode and the optimum position of the propeller fixed inside the tube. Quantitative comparisons of two mixing methods and two digester shapes indicated that mechanical draft tube mixing is more efficient than external pumped recirculation, and that the egg shape provides for more efficient mixing than the cylindrical shape.

Empirical data on experiments comparing different mixing regimes have been reviewed from both a technical and microbial standpoint with a focus both on full scale digesters and in lab-scale evaluations. Lower mixing intensity or uneven mixing in the anaerobic digestion process can be beneficial during the startup phase to allow for methanogenic biomass growth and alleviate process instability problems. Intermittent mixing has been shown to be able to yield a similar gas production as continuous mixing but with the possibility to reduce the maintenance and energy demands of the process. Problems often experienced with experimental design include the effect of mixing on the solids retention time, and measurement of steady state gas production because of startup instabilities. Further research should be aimed at studying the effects of mixing on a chemical and microbial level and on the different stages of anaerobic digestion (hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis and methanogenesis). The focus should be on the effects of mixing on a multiple stage digestion process and also finding new methods to evaluate the effects of mixing in the one stage digestion process rather than evaluating a wider range of mixing modes, intensities and substrates.},

@article{Weiland2010,
abstract = {Anaerobic digestion of energy crops, residues, and wastes is of increasing interest in order to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions and to facilitate a sustainable development of energy supply. Production of biogas provides a versatile carrier of renewable energy, as methane can be used for replacement of fossil fuels in both heat and power generation and as a vehicle fuel. For biogas production, various process types are applied which can be classified in wet and dry fermentation systems. Most often applied are wet digester systems using vertical stirred tank digester with different stirrer types dependent on the origin of the feedstock. Biogas is mainly utilized in engine-based combined heat and power plants, whereas microgas turbines and fuel cells are expensive alternatives which need further development work for reducing the costs and increasing their reliability. Gas upgrading and utilization as renewable vehicle fuel or injection into the natural gas grid is of increasing interest because the gas can be used in a more efficient way. The digestate from anaerobic fermentation is a valuable fertilizer due to the increased availability of nitrogen and the better short-term fertilization effect. Anaerobic treatment minimizes the survival of pathogens which is important for using the digested residue as fertilizer. This paper reviews the current state and perspectives of biogas production, including the biochemical parameters and feedstocks which influence the efficiency and reliability of the microbial conversion and gas yield.},

Methane content ranged from 48{\%} to 65{\%}, carbon dioxide from 36{\%} to 41{\%} and nitrogen from {\textless}1{\%} to 17{\%}. Oxygen content in all three gases was {\textless}1{\%}. The highest methane content occurred in the gas from the sewage digester while the lowest methane and highest nitrogen contents were found in the landfill gas during winter. The amount of total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) varied from 5 to 268mgm−3, and was lowest in the biogas from the farm biogas plant. Hydrogen sulphide and other sulphur compounds occurred in landfill gas and farm biogas and in smaller amounts in the sewage digester gas. Organic silicon compounds were also found in the landfill and sewage digester gases. To conclude, the biogases in the different production plants varied, especially in trace compound content. This should be taken into account when planning uses for biogas.},

Simulation of flow patterns were carried out with a propeller rotating from 400 to 750 rpm, assuming liquid manure to be Newtonian (water) and non-Newtonian fluids depending on the total solids (TS) concentration. Power number and flow number of the propeller in water mixing were validated against lab specifications and experimental data from a field test. The rotational direction and placement of the propeller were examined to identify the primary pumping mode and the optimum position of the propeller fixed inside the tube. Quantitative comparisons of two mixing methods and two digester shapes indicated that mechanical draft tube mixing is more efficient than external pumped recirculation, and that the egg shape provides for more efficient mixing than the cylindrical shape. Furthermore, scale-up rules for mixing in egg-shaped digesters were investigated. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Molasses is a first-generation bioethanol feedstock that is a byproduct of sugar production. Molasses is a viscous fluid; consequently, when it serves as a substrate, it needs to be dissolved in water to obtain the appropriate conditions for the yeast. Therefore, the mixing process of molasses and water is an essential factor that significantly affects the efficiency of the fermentation process. This work aims to study the molasses–water mixing behavior in a cylindrical cone-shaped stirred-tank system reviewed by the effect of the molasses–water rheological characteristics. The molasses–water mixing behavior was investigated through a simple visualization method by using a camera and a 650 nm red laser as an observation plane of molasses–water interface height changes. Based on the results of the rheological characterization, it is known that molasses are a non-Newtonian fluid that exhibits shear thinning behavior. A rheological model molasses–water mixture has been developed. The behavior of molasses–water mixture comprises three zone mechanisms. The Eulerian multiphase model is the closest to the experimental results, and the combination of the Eulerian multiphase model and Large Eddy Simulation can be applied to predict the mixing behavior in an industrial scale stirred-tank.},

abstract = {During high-concentration protein drug product compounding, the property difference between the drug substance solution and the buffer excipient solution can potentially cause the formation of stratified layers, which may prohibit effective mixing. In this study, mixing of two stratified liquids in an unbaffled tank with an angle-mounted impeller was investigated using both experiments and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The results revealed that the mixing time under the stratified conditions could be over an order of magnitude longer than that predicted by a commonly used blend time correlation. Further analysis showed that the observed long mixing time occurred when the buoyancy force due to density difference between the liquids was dominant over the impeller stir and was correlated with high Richardson number. The study also looked into the impact of factors such as liquid height and impeller size, and a new correlation was proposed based on the experimental data.},

Tests for dewatering of sludge are outlined. The capillary suction time is the most widely used dewaterability indicator. Treatment processes associated with lagoons and aerobic digestion are highlighted. Sludge thickening and dewatering processes including chemical conditioning, air drying, and gravity thickening are important. Partial disposal technologies such as incineration, pyrolysis, and composting are explained. Finally, land dumping and passive treatment methods are discussed. After studying this chapter, readers should be able to design simple sludge treatment units and propose associated disposal methods."
